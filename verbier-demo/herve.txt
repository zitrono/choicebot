Hi HervÃ©! Following up on our conversation about AI transformation for Verbier Festival, I had my team produce an extended demo based on 2025 catalogue.

TIMELINE
- NOW: Extended demo ready for testing and feedback
- 6 weeks from sign-off: Production-ready core system
- October 2025: Full 2026 Festival features deployed (firm deadline for print catalogue)
- 2027: Complete ecosystem with all advanced features

By 2027, this won't just be a digital concierge - it will be a sophisticated platform where sponsors become valued partners in each visitor's journey.

The evolution of sponsorship:
2026: Smart contextual integration
2027: Advanced value creation

Examples of what becomes possible in 2027 (experiences enabled by brands):
â€¢ Rolex won't just show a logo - instead: "enabling preservation of your most precious musical memories"
â€¢ Mercedes won't advertise cars - instead: "helping eliminate friction throughout your day"
â€¢ UBS won't push products - instead: "facilitating connections between your wealth and artist support"
â€¢ Four Seasons won't sell rooms - instead: "supporting your well-being throughout the festival"
â€¢ Swiss Air won't promote flights - instead: "creating meaningful connections between like-minded patrons"

The AI can anticipate when you need a shuttle before you check the map. It can recognize when you're having a memorable experience and offer to preserve it. It can identify when you need rest and suggest appropriate options.

While competitors rely on traditional sponsorship models, Verbier's sponsors will solve problems, create memories, and build meaningful connections.

Our implementation roadmap:
2026: Establish core digital concierge capabilities
2027: Introduce advanced sponsor integration

Ready to discuss next steps.

Best,
Konstantin
