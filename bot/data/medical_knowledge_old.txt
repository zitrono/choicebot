## DIAGNOSTIC DECISION TREES

### Headache Assessment Flow
1. Onset? → Sudden/thunderclap → EMERGENCY
2. Fever + neck stiffness? → Yes → EMERGENCY
3. Neurological symptoms? → Yes → URGENT
4. Pattern? → Unilateral throbbing → Likely migraine
5. Triggers? → Stress/tension → Likely tension headache

### Chest Pain Assessment Flow
1. Crushing/pressure? → Yes → EMERGENCY
2. Radiating to arm/jaw? → Yes → EMERGENCY
3. Worse with breathing? → Yes → Likely musculoskeletal/pleuritic
4. Burning, after meals? → Yes → Likely GERD
5. With anxiety symptoms? → Yes → Consider panic disorder

### Abdominal Pain Assessment Flow
1. Severe + rigid abdomen? → Yes → EMERGENCY
2. RLQ pain + fever? → Yes → Possible appendicitis → URGENT
3. Relation to meals? → Worse after → Upper GI issue
4. Blood in stool/vomit? → Yes → URGENT evaluation
5. Intermittent cramping? → Yes → Likely functional/IBS

## MEDICATION QUICK REFERENCE

### Over-the-Counter Pain/Fever:
- **Acetaminophen**: 650-1000mg q6h (max 3g/day, 2g if liver disease)
- **Ibuprofen**: 400-800mg q6-8h with food (max 2400mg/day)
- **Aspirin**: 325-650mg q4h (not for children, bleeding risk)

### Common Drug Interactions:
- NSAIDs + blood thinners = bleeding risk
- Multiple acetaminophen products = liver toxicity
- NSAIDs + BP meds = reduced effectiveness

### When Antibiotics ARE Needed:
- Strep throat (confirmed)
- UTI with symptoms
- Bacterial pneumonia
- Skin infections (cellulitis)
- Dental abscess

### When Antibiotics are NOT Needed:
- Common cold
- Viral bronchitis
- Most sore throats
- Viral gastroenteritis
- Most sinus congestion

## PATIENT EDUCATION POINTS

### Understanding Fever:
- Body's natural defense mechanism
- Treat for comfort, not number
- Danger zone: >104°F adults, >102°F infants <3mo
- Hydration more important than temperature reduction

### Pain Scale Education:
- 0-3: Mild (annoying but functional)
- 4-6: Moderate (interferes with activities)
- 7-9: Severe (unable to do normal activities)
- 10: Worst imaginable pain

### When Symptoms Change:
Always re-evaluate if:
- Sudden worsening
- New symptoms develop
- Not improving as expected
- Red flag symptoms appear
