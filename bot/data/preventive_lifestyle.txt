## LIFESTYLE_PRESCRIPTIONS:

- **CONDITION:** Type 2 Diabetes
  - **NUTRITION:** Mediterranean or DASH diet. Focus on low glycemic index foods, consistent carbohydrate intake. Limit sugar-sweetened beverages and processed foods.
  - **EXERCISE:** 150+ min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (e.g., brisk walking) AND 2+ sessions/week of resistance training.
  - **SLEEP:** 7-9 hours nightly. Address sleep apnea if present.
  - **STRESS:** Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), yoga, or tai chi.
  - **SUPPLEMENTS:** Vitamin D if deficient. Consider Omega-3 fatty acids.
  - **EXPECTED_OUTCOMES:** A1C reduction of 1-2% within 3 months. Weight loss of 5-10%.
  - **MONITORING:** Daily blood glucose, weekly weight, quarterly A1C, annual kidney function test.

- **CONDITION:** Hypertension
  - **NUTRITION:** DASH diet. Sodium intake <1500 mg/day. Increase potassium-rich foods (fruits, vegetables). Limit alcohol to <=1 drink/day for women, <=2 for men.
  - **EXERCISE:** 150+ min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Dynamic resistance training.
  - **SLEEP:** 7-9 hours nightly. Screen for sleep apnea.
  - **STRESS:** Biofeedback, meditation, deep breathing exercises.
  - **SUPPLEMENTS:** Consider Coenzyme Q10, potassium if diet is insufficient.
  - **EXPECTED_OUTCOMES:** Systolic BP reduction of 5-20 mmHg within 1-3 months.
  - **MONITORING:** Home blood pressure monitoring (weekly), clinician visits as advised.

- **CONDITION:** Hyperlipidemia
  - **NUTRITION:** Portfolio or Mediterranean diet. Increase soluble fiber (oats, psyllium), plant sterols, and soy protein. Limit saturated/trans fats.
  - **EXERCISE:** 150+ min/week of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic activity.
  - **SLEEP:** 7-9 hours nightly.
  - **STRESS:** Manage stress to reduce inflammation and cortisol.

## RISK_CALCULATORS:

- **CALCULATOR:** ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus
  - **USE:** Estimates 10-year and lifetime risk for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.
  - **INPUTS:** Age, sex, race, systolic/diastolic BP, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, history of diabetes, smoking status, hypertension treatment status.
  - **OUTPUT:** 10-year risk percentage. Guides statin therapy and BP management decisions.

- **CALCULATOR:** FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool)
  - **USE:** Estimates 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture.
  - **INPUTS:** Age, sex, weight, height, previous fracture, parental hip fracture, smoking, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, alcohol intake, femoral neck bone mineral density (optional).
  - **OUTPUT:** 10-year fracture probability percentage. Guides treatment for osteoporosis.

- **CALCULATOR:** GAIL Model (Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool)
  - **USE:** Estimates 5-year and lifetime risk of developing invasive breast cancer.
  - **INPUTS:** Age, age at first menarche, age at first live birth, number of first-degree relatives with breast cancer, number of previous breast biopsies, presence of atypical hyperplasia.
  - **OUTPUT:** Risk percentages. Guides decisions on chemoprevention and screening frequency.

## PROTOCOLS:

- **PROTOCOL:** Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)
  - **INDICATION:** Suspected white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, or evaluating treatment efficacy.
  - **PROCEDURE:** Patient wears a portable cuff for 24 hours. Device takes readings every 15-30 minutes during the day and 30-60 minutes at night.
  - **INTERPRETATION:** Provides average BP over 24 hours, daytime, and nighttime. Nighttime dipping status is a key prognostic indicator. A non-dipping pattern (nighttime BP drop <10%) indicates higher cardiovascular risk.

- **PROTOCOL:** Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
  - **INDICATION:** Diagnosing prediabetes and gestational diabetes when A1C or fasting glucose are equivocal.
  - **PROCEDURE:**
    1. Patient fasts for 8-12 hours.
    2. Baseline fasting blood glucose is measured.
    3. Patient drinks a standardized 75g glucose solution.
    4. Blood glucose is measured at 1-hour and 2-hour intervals post-ingestion.
  - **INTERPRETATION (Non-pregnant):**
    - **Normal:** 2-hour glucose <140 mg/dL.
    - **Prediabetes:** 2-hour glucose 140-199 mg/dL.
    - **Diabetes:** 2-hour glucose >=200 mg/dL.

## VACCINATION_SCHEDULES (ADULT):

- **VACCINE:** Influenza (Flu)
  - **SCHEDULE:** Annually for all adults.
- **VACCINE:** Tdap/Td
  - **SCHEDULE:** Tdap once, then Td booster every 10 years. Tdap with every pregnancy.
- **VACCINE:** HPV (Human Papillomavirus)
  - **SCHEDULE:** Recommended for all up to age 26. Can be given up to age 45 based on shared clinical decision-making.
- **VACCINE:** Zoster (Shingles) - Recombinant (Shingrix)
  - **SCHEDULE:** Two doses for all adults age 50+.
- **VACCINE:** Pneumococcal (PCV20 or PCV15+PPSV23)
  - **SCHEDULE:** Recommended for all adults 65+ and for younger adults with specific chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart/lung disease, immunocompromise).
- **VACCINE:** MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella)
  - **SCHEDULE:** Adults born after 1957 should have at least one dose unless they have evidence of immunity.
