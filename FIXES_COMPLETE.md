# ✅ Verbier Chatbot Fixed and Redeployed!

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Streaming Response Bug** ✅
- **Problem**: Chat was looking for `'0:'` prefix in streaming responses
- **Solution**: Fixed parser to handle plain text from Vercel AI SDK
- **File**: `lib/use-chat.ts`

### 2. **Empty Response on Greeting** ✅
- **Problem**: Bot didn't know how to respond to "hello"
- **Solution**: Added greeting handler to system prompt
- **File**: `lib/system-prompt.ts`

### 3. **Better User Onboarding** ✅
- **Problem**: Empty chat screen was confusing
- **Solution**: Added welcome message with 4 starter buttons
- **File**: `app/page.tsx`

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### When User Visits:
1. **Welcome Screen** shows with 4 starter options:
   - 🎼 Start Personalized Journey
   - ⭐ Festival Highlights
   - 🏔️ Unique Verbier Experiences
   - 🎫 First Timer's Guide

2. **Click any button** to start the conversation

3. **Or type "hello"** - the bot will immediately start its preference discovery process

### The Bot's Response Pattern:
When triggered (by greeting or starter button), the bot will:
1. Present 4-6 diverse preference options
2. Guide through a funnel-style discovery
3. Create personalized festival programs
4. Focus on unique Verbier experiences

## 📝 Test Prompts to Try

1. **"Hello"** - Triggers full preference discovery

## 🚀 What Makes This Special

Your system prompt creates a sophisticated funnel that:

- **Narrows intelligently** based on selections
- **Includes 10% discovery** - adjacent recommendations

- **Emphasizes Verbier uniqueness** - alpine venues, summer experiences

## 📊 Expected Behavior

2. Bot presents preference options (not just empty response!)
3. User selects preferences
4. Bot creates personalized program
5. Includes "only in Verbier" experiences
6. Guides toward booking decision
